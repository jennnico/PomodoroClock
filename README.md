# PomodoroClock
A Pomodoro Clock is a combination of two timers. Set your work time and break time (in minutes). 
Work time increments by 5 minutes and break time increments by 1 minute.
When you click start, you will see your time remaining in minutes and seconds. A progress bar is included.
Once both timers run out, you can choose to reset the clock for another work session.
